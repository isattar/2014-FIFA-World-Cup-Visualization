                        In honor of the 2015 FIFA World Cup we decided to visualize the FIFA World Cup Archives as made available on
                        https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup. The dataset consists of information on all
                        the matches that have occurred in World Cups starting from 1930 to 2010, and it also has the
                        scheduled matches for the 2014 World Cup. We will also be augmenting this dataset by webscrapping yellow/red card stats and filling in any missing matches directly from the official FIFA website. Our visualization should give users some insight about
                        the countries which will be participating in the upcoming World Cup and allow them to draw some of the
                        following conclusions.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        1. Which countries are participating in the World Cup and how do they stack up against each other?<br>
                        2. How often and how long will the players need to travel to be able to reach the stadiums they're playing at?<br>
                        3. How has the country statistically done in the previous World Cups?

                    <p class="">
                        In the main menu the user will be presented with an interactive map of Brazil which allows the user
                        to pan and zoom around the country. There will be four groups to the left of the interactive map and
                        four groups to the right, which represent the countries that will be participating in the group stage of the World Cup.
                        The user will be able to hover over the groups and select them by clicking on the mouse.
                        As the user hover overs the groups the group will be highlighted and the user will be allowed to
                        click to lock the selection in place. We'll visualize the travel distance for each country that is participating
                        so that we can get an idea of how much the players will need to travel and the change in climates.

                        The user will also be allowed to click on an individual country and then will be taken to a dashboard for
                        that specific country and in it we will display stats for that country. For example
                        the user will be able to see the all time ranking for that country, the number of red/yellow cards received, best
                        performance in World Cups, etc. This visualization will allow users to be able to get a more in depth analysis of how a country typically
                        performs in World Cups.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From this dashboard, the user can access the matchup predictor by selecting one of the scheduled group stage matches of that country.

                        In this part of our visualization, we will use the history of wins and losses between pairs of countries from previous World Cups
                        to predict what the outcome of the scheduled matches during the group stage of the 2014 World Cup will be. The user will be able to see how the countries compare in regards to total wins, penalties and goals scored for all the World Cups participated in by each country throughout
                        the years. From this, we hope to aid the user in determining which country
                        would most likely win each group stage match.
