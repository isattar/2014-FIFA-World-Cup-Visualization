<p>This visualization was developed as part of the upper-division class on Information Interfaces at UC Davis. I collaborated on this project with two other undergraduates in my class, Mario Yepez and William Baron. </p>

<a id="goaldataset" class="anchor" href="#goaldataset" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal/Dataset</h3>

<p>In honor of the 2014 FIFA World Cup we decided to visualize the FIFA World Cup Archives as made available on <a href="https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup">https://github.com/openfootball/world-cup</a>. The dataset consists of information on all the matches that have occurred in World Cups starting from 1930 to 2010 and it has the scheduled matches for the 2014 World Cup. We also augmented this dataset by web scrapping red/yellow card stats and filling in any missing matches directly from the official FIFA website. Our visualization should give users some insight about the countries which will be participating in the upcoming World Cup and allow them to draw some of the following conclusions. 
1. Which countries are participating in the World Cup and how do they stack up against each other?
2. How often and how long will the players need to travel to be able to reach the stadiums they're playing at?
3. How has the country statistically done in the previous World Cups?</p>

<a id="interactive-map-view" class="anchor" href="#interactive-map-view" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interactive Map View</h3>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6263006/10704207/1ce88332-798a-11e5-98ce-e26d9ee503c2.jpg" alt="Interactive  Map View"></p>

<p>In the main menu the user is presented with an interactive map of Brazil. There are four groups to the left of the interactive map and four groups to the right, which represent the countries that will be participating in the group stage of the World Cup. The user will be able to hover over the groups and select them by clicking on the mouse. As the user hover overs the groups the group will be highlighted and the user will be allowed to click to lock the selection in place. We'll visualize the travel distance for each country that is participating so that we can get an idea of how much the players will need to travel and the change in climates.</p>

<h3>
<a id="country-dashboard" class="anchor" href="#country-dashboard" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Country Dashboard</h3>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6263006/10704209/1f8f3298-798a-11e5-8579-5b09ffca19ec.jpg" alt="Country Dashboard"></p>

<p>The user can click on an individual country in the Interactive Map View and then will be taken to a dashboard for that specific country. In the country dashboard, we will display stats for that country. For example the user will be able to see the all time ranking for that country, the number of red/yellow cards received, etc. This visualization will allow users to be able to get a more in depth analysis of how a specific country typically performs in World Cups. </p>

<p>From this dashboard, the user can access the matchup predictor by selecting one of the scheduled group stage matches of that country.</p>

<h3>
<a id="matchup-predictor" class="anchor" href="#matchup-predictor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Matchup Predictor</h3>

<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6263006/10704208/1e38e394-798a-11e5-8ecb-9146fd82e5fe.jpg" alt="Matchup Predictor"></p>

<p>In this part of our visualization, we will use the history of wins and losses between pairs of countries from previous World Cups to predict what the outcome of the scheduled matches during the group stage of the 2014 World Cup will be. The user will be able to see how the countries compare in regards to total wins, penalties and goals scored for all the World Cups participated in by each country throughout the years. From this, we hope to aid the user in determining which country would most likely win each group stage match.</p>
